# ecommerce (Work-in-progress)

Very much still a work-in-progress when I have time - this will eventually be tied into my upcoming ttrpg project!

basic ecommerce website from scratch - sort of... *Now using DND5e API!*

Imagine if the D&D Universe had a magical-computer-like system that could order weapons and armor from it (like... Newegg or Amazon!), well, that's this!

View available equipment, add it to your cart, and checkout, all for your stuff to be delivered to you from your nearest craftsmith by post (snail-mail) - expedited delivery options available for a fee (same-day-air, same-day-magic-delivery, etc.!)
